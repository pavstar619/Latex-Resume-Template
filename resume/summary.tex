From the moment I developed my first website using raw HTML and CSS, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been “just a job” for me, it’s offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple website has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.

Below you’ll find projects I’ve completed that showcase my skills and general background in developing software.
